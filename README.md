# CS236781: Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators
# Homework Assignment 3

Faculty of Computer Science, Technion.

## Introduction

In this assignment we'll learn to generate text with a deep multilayer RNN network based on GRU cells.
Then we'll focus our attention on image generation and implement two different generative models:
A variational autoencoder and a generative adversarial network.


## General Guidelines

- Please read the [getting started page](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/assignments/getting-started) on the course website. It explains how to **setup, run and submit** the assignment.
- This assignment requires running on GPU-enabled hardware.
- The text and code cells in these notebooks are intended to guide you through the
  assignment and help you verify your solutions.
